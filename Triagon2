When the second Triagon descended from the newly emerging mass of Life, the world was mired in confusion and chaos. The overwhelming clutter of biology got on its nerves, it demanded calm. The feeding begins.

It saw visions of guts, of decay and metabolism. The opportunity had come to extend a cavern of intestines deep into the ground. To start processing the glut of excess organic mass. To introduce limits to writhing and shitting. Chlorhydric acid.

Existence became a scarce product, and the nervebags came to detest the limits. Suffering was born. The second Triagon was content with its power. It was happy. Metabolic domination.
